My father has got a solar water heater system with a SPIII Solar Water Heater Controller.
The controller itself is some crappy closed source with a bad interface (non-standard compliant HTML interface) - however it works.

In order to collect all environmental data from the house we decided to buy a [Raspberry PI](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) and a few [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) devices.

So far we are able to collect data from the SPIII Solar Water Heater Controller using `curl` and from the [Current Cost](http://www.currentcost.com/) device (via cosm.com as proxy) using the following bash code:

The result so far in emoncms:
